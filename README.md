# Network Discovery & Port Scanning Tool

## Overview
This project demonstrates foundational networking concepts by discovering live hosts
on a local network and scanning common TCP ports.

## Tools Used
- PowerShell (ICMP discovery)
- Python (TCP socket scanning)
- SQL (data storage & analysis)

## Networking Concepts
- OSI & TCP/IP models
- ICMP (Layer 3)
- TCP ports & services (Layer 4)

## How It Works
1. PowerShell script identifies live hosts
2. Python script scans common ports
3. Results stored and analyzed using SQL

## Security Note
All scans were performed on my own local lab network.
Unauthorized scanning is illegal.
